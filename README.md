🎬 Movie Recommendation System — Overview

A Movie Recommendation System is an application of Machine Learning that suggests movies to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarity to other users/movies.
It’s one of the most popular examples of Recommender Systems in ML.

🧠 Goal

To predict and recommend movies that a user is likely to watch or enjoy — improving user engagement and satisfaction (like Netflix, IMDb, or Prime Video do).

⚙️ Types of Recommendation Systems

🎯 Content-Based Filtering

Recommends movies similar to what the user has already liked.

Uses movie features like genre, director, cast, or keywords.

Example: If you liked Inception, it recommends Interstellar (same genre/director).

👥 Collaborative Filtering

Recommends movies based on user behavior patterns.

Uses user ratings or interactions.

Example: If User A and User B both liked Titanic, and A liked Avatar, B might get Avatar recommended.

Techniques:

User-User Filtering

Item-Item Filtering

Matrix Factorization (e.g., using SVD)

🧩 Hybrid Approach

Combines content-based and collaborative methods for better accuracy and personalization.

🧰 Steps in Building a Movie Recommender System

Data Collection — e.g., MovieLens dataset (movie titles, genres, ratings).

Data Preprocessing — handle missing data, normalize ratings, extract text features.

Feature Extraction — e.g., using TF-IDF on movie descriptions.

Similarity Calculation — using Cosine Similarity or Euclidean Distance.

Model Building — apply collaborative filtering or ML models like KNN or SVD.

Recommendation Generation — suggest top-N similar movies for each user.

📊 Common Libraries Used

pandas, numpy — for data handling

scikit-learn — for similarity and modeling

surprise — for collaborative filtering

nltk / TF-IDF Vectorizer — for text-based features
